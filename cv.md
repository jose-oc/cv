## Professional Experience

### **NEP Group** — *DevOps / Platform Engineer*  
**Nov 2022 – Present | Málaga, Spain**

- Automated deployment and configuration of infrastructure and observability stacks (**Grafana, Loki, InfluxDB, Promtail, Telegraf, MinIO**) on Kubernetes using **Ansible**, reducing setup time from days to **under an hour**.
- Developed Python scripts integrated into **GitHub Actions** to sync Docker images and Helm charts with a private **Google Artifact Registry**, ensuring reliable artifact availability.
- Created Python CLI tools to automate internal workflows:
  - Syncing **Ansible inventory** with **1Password** and generating scaffolding.
  - Generating **Confluence documentation** from HTML templates and inventory variables.
- Designed and implemented **cost-optimization automation** for AWS (EC2, ECS, and Lambda): instance rightsizing, spot-instance usage, automated environment startup/shutdown.
- Built runbooks for recurring incidents, improving on-call efficiency and response consistency.
- Managed 30+ distributed datacenters, each with multiple Kubernetes nodes and VMs, ensuring observability and stability across all environments.

**Key Projects**
- **CI/CD + Python integration:** GitHub Actions automation to manage internal registries.
- **AWS cost optimization:** Python Lambda functions and Terraform pipelines for dynamic resource control.
- **Infrastructure automation:** Ansible-driven stack deployments (Proxmox, Talos, Grafana, Loki, MinIO) with retention and user policies.

### **Piksel Inc** — *Lead Developer / DevOps Engineer*  
**Mar 2015 – Nov 2022 | Málaga, Spain**

- Led a cross-functional team of six developers and DevOps engineers building a distributed **Python-based workflow platform** (similar to N8N) to process large-scale media workloads on AWS.
- Designed modular **Python libraries (“steps”)** for transcoding videos, generating metadata, processing subtitles, and analyzing video content — connected via standardized inputs/outputs for composable workflows.
- Used **pytest** for testing, **boto3** for AWS interactions, and **Terraform** for infrastructure provisioning.
- Developed a **Lambda function** to manage AWS RDS startup/shutdown via schedule or manual triggers from GoCD pipelines, optimizing costs and reducing idle usage.
- Created and maintained **Terraform CI/CD pipelines** using GoCD and GitLab CI for continuous infrastructure delivery.
- Collaborated with developers to integrate observability and logging, leveraging ElasticSearch/Kibana for debugging and performance insights.
- Achieved **15% operational cost reduction** by automating provisioning and improving resource utilization.

**Key Technologies:** Python, AWS (Batch, Lambda, EC2, RDS, Dynamo, S3), Terraform, GitLab CI, GoCD, pytest, boto3, Docker, Ansible
